Quick start:

```
$ yarn # npm install
$ yarn build # npm run build
```

## Development

Run Webpack in watch-mode to continually compile the JavaScript as you work:

```
$ yarn watch # npm run watch
```

I've added to an existing app saving notes in localStorage, lazy state, delete note, bumping recent note to the top, auto note title change
